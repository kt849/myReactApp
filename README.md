# myReactApp
A pet adoption application, made using React, HTML and CSS.


This is a simple webapp made while learning React.js which enables users to do the following:
- Search for pets based on their location, breed and what kind of animal they are looking for.
- Displays various pictures of the pets in a Carousel.
- Displays various information on how they can adopt a particular pet.

The app uses Parcel for bundling, and uses the reach-router for routing through various routes.
